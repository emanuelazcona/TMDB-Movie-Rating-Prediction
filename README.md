Is it possible to predict a movie's critic success before it is even released? Are there key/certain cast members (actors/actresses) or essential crew (directors, producers, etc.) that contribute to the critical success of a movie? In this project we investigate and create an appropiate regression model for predicting a movie's IMDB critic rating based on different attributes like: cast, crew, and more.

In this project, critic rating is given to us in the form of a non-integer score between $0$ and $10$.
